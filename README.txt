Ball Clock 

Mode 1
The first mode takes a single parameter specifying the number of balls then gives the number of days which pass before the
clock balls returns to their initial ordering.

Mode 2
The second mode takes two parameters, the number of balls and the number of minutes to run and outputs the final state.
